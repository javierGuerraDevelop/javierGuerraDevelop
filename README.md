## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Javier Guerra, I am a software engineer based in Miami, Florida. During the pandemic I began to study how to make some websites and that led to me attending a coding bootcamp with the University of Miami. This gave me the skills I wanted to learn how to make more complex sites and now work full-time as a software engineer. I enjoy engineering more each day which led me to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science so I can go deeper into fundamentals and CS theory. My main language is javascript so I can work on both the frontend and the backend. Besides that I use python for leetcode mainly.
