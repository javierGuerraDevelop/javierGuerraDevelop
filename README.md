## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Javier Guerra, I am a software engineer based in Gainesville, Florida. I started coding to make some websites and that led to me attending a coding bootcamp with the University of Miami. This gave me the skills I wanted to learn how to make more complex sites and work as a software engineer. I enjoy solving complex problems which led me to pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science so I can go deeper into fundamentals and CS theory. Besides coding I enjoy playing World of Warcraft with my friends.
